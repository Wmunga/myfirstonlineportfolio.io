        <img src="Wonder_photo.jpg" alt="Wonder Munga" class="profile-pic">
        <p>Wonder Munga is a 23-year-old aspiring software engineer with a background in chemical engineering. I began my coding journey in March 2025 with the Power Learn Project, starting formal software engineering training on March 24, 2025. With prior experience as an attache operator at KenGen Kipevu (2023) and KPRL (2024), I’m now blending my technical expertise with skills in web development, database creation, and Python programming. My goal is to develop innovative solutions bridging engineering and software.</p>
